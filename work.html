                    <h2>Architectural Shapes and Forms</h2>
                    <p>This project recreates dynamic architectural forms found on the University of San Francisco campus. A unique set of limitations, especially in terms of the color scheme, guided the direction taken with the illustrations. Color was a tool carefully employed to guarantee that the illustrations were legible as three dimensional forms.

                    <h2>Picturing Design</h2>
                    <p>This project was an initial foray into the world of photography (using an SLR). Prior to this, the only camera Diego had ever used was an iPhone. The images import a sense of symmetry and balance from graphic design, coupled with captions lifted from automatic voicemail responses. Through the juxtaposition of workplace attire with the natural world, the project delivers  a message about the existential weight and irregularity of the corporate environment. In its construction, the project emphasized Diego’s desire to use practical locations as much as possible.</p>

                    <h2>Icons of San Francisco</h2>
                    <p>Icon takes on two meanings; not only did it define the style and form of the work, but it also outlined a creative direction where iconic representations of the San Francisco area were selected. Rather than focusing on the city itself or its man-made legacy, Diego chose to focus on the native fauna of the area. The final icons depict the red-legged frog, a Mission blue butterfly atop a pink sea thrift (native flora), and a San Francisco Garter Snake. The animal illustrations are paired with circular backdrops that can be recolored for variation.</p>

                    <h2>LUNA Logo Redesign</h2>
                    <p>In the role of Public Relations executive for the Latine Undergraduate Network of Activists (LUNA), Diego developed a new logo to be used for the organization’s materials and online presence. The goal was to create a simple and legible logo that was imbued with LUNA’s identity. The main inspiration for the design was the decorative motifs of indigenous Mexico. Necessary inclusions within the design were the full name and acronym of the organization, as well as the moon phases motif in reference to the LUNA moniker. This project was an exercise in revisions and client satisfaction that had multiple iterations passed along to the executive board until the final product was approved.</p>
